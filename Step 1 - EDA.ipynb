    "# GA4 Ecommerce EDA Snapshot\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis window:** Nov 1–30, 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "**Engine:** SQL queries executed directly in **Google BigQuery**\n",
    "\n",
    "## TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "We ran 6 focused EDA queries to check dataset size, funnel coverage, session feasibility, field quality, ecommerce reliability, and traffic-source usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 1.47M events, 108K sessions, complete commerce tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Only 44% usable attribution data\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 Focus: Funnel leakage, device/geo segments, session behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we confirmed\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scale is solid:** 1.47M events, 79,421 users, 108,401 sessions, 17 event types (Nov only).\n",
    "* **Session analysis is valid:** we can reconstruct sessions using\n",
    "  `session_key = CONCAT(user_pseudo_id, '-', ga_session_id)`.\n",
    "* **Funnel is measurable:** all core events exist (`view_item`, `add_to_cart`, `begin_checkout`, `purchase`).\n",
    "* **This is a reach-based funnel:** it shows who touched each stage, not strict step-by-step order.\n",
    "* **Commerce fields are usable:** transactions + revenue are present and good enough for KPI reporting.\n",
    "* **Traffic source needs caution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * only **44.33%** users are in clearly usable attributed source/medium values\n",
    "  * **55.67%** are default or obfuscated buckets\n",
    "  * source distribution is highly concentrated (top 3 sources = **89.49%**)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key interpretation decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **transaction-level** counts for finance metrics (not raw purchase event count).\n",
    "* Exclude `shipping_value` from KPI logic in this slice (100% null on purchase rows).\n",
    "* Treat `traffic_source.source/medium` as **secondary context** (first-touch, coarse channel cuts).\n",
    "* Keep an explicit **Unknown/Obfuscated** channel bucket in any source/medium report.\n",
    "* Do not make deep attribution claims from this sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this enables next\n",
    "\n",
    "We can confidently move into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Funnel leakage analysis (especially product view → cart gap)\n",
    "2. Device/geo segmentation of conversion + revenue\n",
    "3. Session-level behavior patterns tied to conversion outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "And we should keep attribution analysis as a limited, caveated layer — not the core story.\n"
