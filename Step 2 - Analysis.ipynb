    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Non-cart purchase path is the dominant revenue engine\n",
    "\n",
    "* `purchase_non_cart` drives **73.20% of transactions** and **71.08% of deduped revenue**.\n",
    "* `purchase_cart_assisted` drives **26.68% of transactions** and **28.92% of deduped revenue**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning:**\n",
    "Most monetization comes from sessions that purchase without cart as a valid prior step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Cart-assisted path is smaller, but higher value per order\n",
    "\n",
    "* AOV:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `purchase_cart_assisted`: **77.44**\n",
    "  * `purchase_non_cart`: **69.38**\n",
    "* Avg revenue per purchase session:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * cart-assisted: **83.94**\n",
    "  * non-cart: **71.81**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning:**\n",
    "Cart-assisted buyers are fewer, but basket value is higher.\n",
    "So this is a **volume vs value** split, not a winner-takes-all path decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Biggest near-term loss is non-cart checkout abandonment\n",
    "\n",
    "* `checkout_no_purchase_non_cart`: **2,538 sessions**\n",
    "* `checkout_no_purchase_cart_assisted`: **432 sessions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-cart checkout abandonment is ~**85.45%** of checkout-no-purchase sessions (`2,538 / (2,538+432)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning:**\n",
    "If optimizing checkout completion, non-cart checkout flow is the highest-impact target.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Large “other_or_no_funnel” share is expected at session level\n",
    "\n",
    "* `other_or_no_funnel` = **76.01% of all sessions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning:**\n",
    "Most sessions do not enter the core ecommerce funnel events (`view_item/cart/checkout/purchase`) and are browsing/navigation-heavy. This is normal in event-level ecommerce traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats to keep explicit\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `purchase_rate_pct = 100%` for purchase-labeled families is by construction (label definition), not a performance rate.\n",
    "2. `revenue_event_level` is much higher than `revenue_txn_dedup` for non-cart path (108,696 vs 86,029), indicating potential duplicate purchase-event firing; deduped revenue is the safer economics view.\n",
    "3. Transaction IDs appear reused/duplicated enough that economics should be presented with the dedup method clearly documented.\n"
